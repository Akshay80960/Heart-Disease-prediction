# Heart-Disease-prediction

ABSTRACT :

Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.   
 Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyper-lipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.   
Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. The prediction model can be introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. We can classify whether a patient has a heart disease or not using the data. Applying machine learning techniques result in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease.

 DATASET INFORMATION([heart(2).csv])  :

•	Age - age of the person   
•	Anaemia - Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)   
•	Creatinine Phosphokinase - Level of CPK enzyme in the blood (mg/L)  
•	Diabetes - If the patient has diabetes (boolean)  
•	Ejection Fraction - Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)   
•	High Blood Pressure - If the patient has hypertension (boolean)   
•	Platelets - Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)   
•	Serum Creatinine - Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)   
•	Serum Sodium - Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)  
•	Sex - Woman or man (binary) Smoking - If the patient smokes or not (boolean)   
•	DEATH_EVENT - If the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean) 


CONCLUSION : 
  
Our machine learning algorithm can now classify patients with Heart Disease. Now we can properly diagnose patients, & get them the help they needs to recover. By diagnosing detecting these features early, we may prevent worse symptoms from arising later. In this research we have tried to compare different machine learning algorithms and predict if a certain person, given various personal characteristics and symptoms, will get heart disease or not. The main motive of our report was to comparing the accuracy and analyzing the reasons behind the variation of different algorithms.  
 
We have divided the data into two sections which are training and testing datasets. We have considered different attributes and will implement three different algorithms to analyse the accuracy. Probably for other instances and other datasets other algorithm may work in better way. Moreover, if we increase the attributes, maybe we can found more accurate result but it will take more time to process and the system will be slower than now as it will be little more complex and will be handling more data.
